If you're reading this, I mistakenly uploaded this test post to the Internet -- oops! :o

But while you're here: I am currently implementing a tagging system to my website's blog. The goal is to allow users to browse blog posts per category (e.g. posts about research, life updates, the PhD, etc). I am once again drawing from Renkon's excellent 11ty guide while implementing this system -- thank you, Renkon!
