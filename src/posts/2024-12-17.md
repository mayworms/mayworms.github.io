Good news! I recently completed the "1.0" [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) version of my website redesign. I am currently configuring it for Github Pages in order to get it online (thank you to my friend [Nathan](https://www.si.umich.edu/people/nathan-kim) for troubleshooting the Github Actions errors, couldn't have gotten this online without your help!). My website may go down intermittently as we work out any potential errors, but hopefully it'll all work out soon enough.
