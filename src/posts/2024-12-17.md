Good news! I recently finished redesigning my website with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) (or 11ty). I used to use a GitHub Pages Jekyll template called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) for my personal website, but eventually decided to build a website from scratch -- several of my friends suggested that I do so in Eleventy, a simple static site generator. I was an absolute beginner with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so the redesign took several months of jumping between: 

* Renkon's [Eleventy guide](https://renkotsuban.com/posts/2023-11-15-Migrating-to-Eleventy.html) (drew heavily from this excellent guide while getting started)
* Official [Eleventy documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/) (sometimes helpful, but I wish it wasn't so sparse!)
* MDN's [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) and [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) tutorials

After I finished building my website locally, my friend [Nathan](https://nathan-kim.org) helped me configure it for [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) -- thank you, Nathan! 

The thing that surprised me the most was how much fun I had designing and building this site. Seriously, you should have seen my face after I got the mobile-view hamburger menu animation working (which took me four hours to do -- seriously, go check it out on your phone, it's so cool). I'm sure I'll continue to tweak and improve the website over time (I've already increased the mobile view font size quite a bit), but for now, I think I'll just let myself feel proud of it. :D
