Good news! I recently finished redesigning my website with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev" target="blank">Eleventy</a> (or 11ty), a simple static site generator. I used to use a GitHub Pages Jekyll template for my personal website, but later decided to design and build my own website from scratch. I was an absolute beginner with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so the redesign took several months of jumping between: 

* Renkon's <a href="https://renkotsuban.com/posts/2023-11-15-Migrating-to-Eleventy.html" target="blank">Eleventy guide</a> (drew heavily from this excellent guide while getting started)
* Official <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/docs/" target="blank">Eleventy documentation</a> (sometimes helpful, though I wish it wasn't so sparse!)
* Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="blank">Web Docs</a> (specifically their <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS" target="blank">CSS</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="blank">Javascript</a> reference sheets)

After I finished building my website locally, my friend <a href="https://nathan-kim.org" target="blank"><b>Nathan Kim</b></a> helped me configure it for <a href="https://pages.github.com" target="blank">GitHub Pages</a> -- thank you, Nathan! 

The thing that surprised me the most was how much fun I had designing and building this site. Seriously, you should have seen my face after I got the mobile-view hamburger menu animation working (which took me four hours to do -- seriously, go check it out on your phone, it's so cool). I'm sure I'll continue to tweak and improve the website over time (I've already increased the mobile view font size quite a bit), but for now, I think I'll just let myself feel proud of it. :D
