It’s quite cold outside today! 

What was I up to this past week? I worked on a literature review for my advisor's paper, co-worked with a friend at a lovely cafe downtown, wrapped up an IRB resubmission, caught a shiny Absol in Pokémon Go, and complained about Ben Johnson going to the Bears. Occasionally I would check my notifications, see another glimmer of the nightmare horrors approaching trans people (and everyone else) in the United States, and turn my phone off. 

In brighter news: my friend [Ria Khan](https://www.iamfriak.com) just had a paper (conditionally) accepted to the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (aka [CHI 2025](https://chi2025.acm.org))! If you're reading this, please clap your hands and say: "congratulations, Ria!" Will update this post (once I drive home lol) with the paper's official title and abstract content; in the meantime, I wish to express that I am incredibly proud of my friend Ria for their paper acceptance, and look forward to traveling with them to Yokohama in the spring :D 

On that note: remind me to finish that CHI workshop paper!
