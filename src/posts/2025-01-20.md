It’s quite cold outside today! 

What was I up to this past week? I worked on a literature review for my advisor's paper, co-worked with a friend at a lovely cafe downtown, wrapped up an IRB resubmission, caught a shiny Absol in Pokémon Go, drew a picture of some old library friends, and complained about Ben Johnson going to the Bears. Every once in a while I would check my phone notifications, catch another glimpse of the nightmare horrors looming over trans people (and everyone else) in the United States, then turn my phone back off and shove it deep into my pocket. 

In brighter news: I am very proud of my friend <a href="https://www.iamfriak.com" target="blank"><b>Ria Khan</b></a>, whose first-authored paper was just accepted to the ACM (Association of Computing Machinery) CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (aka <a href="https://chi2025.acm.org" target="blank"><b>CHI 2025</b></a>)! I will write an expanded version of this post in the coming weeks with a full list of our research lab's accepted CHI submissions; in the meantime, I wish to share how very proud of my friends for their paper acceptances, and that I look forward to traveling with them to Yokohama in the spring :D 

(On that note: remind me to finish that workshop paper!)
