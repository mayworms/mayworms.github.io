                <strong>2025 May 05</strong>
                
                <p>Greetings from... Ann Arbor! I returned from Yokohama to Ann Arbor late last week; after spending the weekend trudging through jet lag, I am now back to work as usual. Here is a recap of the second half of my CHI 2025 experience:</p>
<h3>29 April (Tuesday)</h3>
<p>Day 2 of CHI 2025: Today was a little more subdued than the past few days; no big Tokyo trips or queer get-togethers this time, just a day spent conference-ing (with a few detours!).</p>
<p>After attending a morning paper session, I stood in line for an hour to grab a commemerative CHI 2025 <em>maneki-neko</em> plushie! I was lucky enough to get in line early and buy a plushie before the all sold out... they sound incredibly popular! ‚Çç^. .^‚Çé‚üÜ</p>
<div class="gallery">

</div>
<p>I had <em>tonkatsu</em> for lunch with my friend Kevin Zheng today; we talked a bit about conducting research in 2025, getting to visit our respective &quot;motherlands,&quot; and making sure to have fun while we're here! I'm a bit of a workaholic, so prioritizing &quot;fun&quot; can be difficult for me. Still, Kevin made a good point: I only get so many opportunities to visit The Motherland‚Ñ¢ lol, might as well enjoy it! (¬¥ Àò `)</p>
<p>Later that day, I had an awful realization: my eyesight was really, <em>really</em> bad! My prescription was at least two years out of date, and I really struggled throughout the day to see my friends' presentation slides. After attending a few more paper sessions, I snuck back to the Minato Mirai JINS location to complete an eye exam, update my prescription, and buy a new pair of glasses! Though I was nervous about whether my Japanese is good enough to get through an eye exam, everything went completely fine (though several staff members also spoke English lol). My replacement glasses are excellent, only took about 40 minutes to make, and were much more affordable than glasses usually are in the USA (even with insurance!). I'm happy I took that JINS detour, it feels great to see again! ‡¥¶‡µç‡¥¶‡¥ø(‚éö_‚éö)</p>
<div class="gallery">

</div>
<p>Later, a few friends and I got <em>yakiniku</em> for dinner in downtown Yokohama. It's funny, despite having lived in/near Yokohama for several years of my life, I'd never actually been downtown at night before this trip. It dawned on me why most of my memories of Japan were in the daytime: I was a child back then, so I was probably in bed by sundown! &quot;(„Å£- ‚Ä∏ - œÇ)·∂ª ùóì ê∞Å</p>
<h3>30 April (Wednesday)</h3>
<p>Day 3 of CHI 2025: One problem I've had throughout this trip is very, very poor sleep. I only got around 5 hours of sleep most nights; I didn't have much time to get past jet lag between arriving in Japan and the beginning of the conference, and I was <em>really</em> feeling it by Wednesday. Ever lie there in bed just <em>begging</em> for your brain to fall back asleep, and it just... won't? Not fun! .¬∑¬∞’û(‚âß‚ñ°‚â¶)’û¬∞¬∑.</p>
<p>Grabbed breakfast at 7-Eleven (I think had konbini food for breakfast literally every day I was in Japan LOL), went to the conference, watched a presentation, then checked out the poster presentation with my friend (and our lab's postdoc) Kat Brewster. We talked a bit about food in Japan and how many major rail hubs double as shopping malls (imagine if American transit hubs worked similarly!). We also talked about the sheer, sheer amount of AI-related research at CHI this year -- that's every tech conference these days, but still, sheesh! (ñ¶πÔπèñ¶π;)</p>
<div class="gallery">

</div>
<p>Later that afternoon, I attended the lgbTq SIG, where most conversation centered the current wave of anti-trans executive orders and policy activity in the United States, the cancellations of trans-related research grants, and how to conduct trans-related research in such conditions. I felt heartened talking to so many people who have suffered similarly under these conditions, not unlike how I felt at the CHI Queers get-together a few nights prior. It helps to not feel alone, doesn't it? ( ‚∏ù‚∏ù¬¥Íí≥`‚∏ù‚∏ù)</p>
<p>Took the train to the Yokohama Pokemon Center after the day's conference stuff wrapped up. I'd been to a Pokemon Center in Tokyo before, but never Yokohama's, it was really nice! I picked up a few plushies and figurines as gifts for friends (and a few plushies for myself, had to grab that West Side Gastrodon lol). During check-out, the cashier asked me if I was learning Japanese in school; when I explained to her that I lived in Japan as a child before immigrating, she laughed and said she thinks I'm quite good at Japanese! I deeply appreciated her kind words -- I sometimes feel very insecure about my so-so Japanese skills, and feel relieved that I at least know enough to get by in the country (as a visitor, anyways).</p>

    </figure>
</div>
<p>I returned to downtown Yokohama again that night to get <em>omakase</em> dinner with Hibby Thach and several other friends. Omakase was also a new experience for me, and I deeply enjoyed it (even if the chef put <em>lots</em> of wasabi under some of those salmon slices)! Japanese <em>miso</em> soup often includes a lot of baby clams; every time I see them, I think about those hot, humid July afternoons where I'd go clam-digging with family on the beaches in Fukuoka. ...How long has it been since I've been to the beach? (‚äô_‚äô)</p>
<h3>01 May (Thursday)</h3>
<p>Day 4 of CHI 2025: Woke up today feeling very glum, and walked to the convention center feeling melancholic about leaving Yokohama tomorrow. Last day of CHI 2025, last day in Japan... for me, anyways! My roommate, professor, and many friends would stay in Japan longer for personal vacation time -- despite the cost, I wish I'd chosen to stay longer too.</p>
<p>Watched Kat Brewster's presentation on co-designing AR face filter technologies with trans people themselves -- they noted at the end of their presentation that our lab had to stop development of their AR face filter app prototype after the NSF grant funding the project was terminated. ...What a bleak, unfair, cruel, and senseless state of affairs.</p>

</div>
<p>I spoke with some friends, handed out some business cards, and said some &quot;see you laters&quot; before making my way to the closing plenary. I initially considered skipping the closing plenary to make more time for myself, but I wound up going anyways. The closing presentation was given by Masako Wakamiya; she dwelled on learning to code in her 80s, creating art in Microsoft Excel based on traditional Japanese fabric patterns, and developing inclusive technologies for aging populations. What a beautiful presentation! I wonder if I'll still be thinking about technology at her age? (‚Äû‚òÖ0‚òÖ‚Äû)</p>

</div>
<p>A few closing words and acknowledgements later, and CHI 2025 officially came to an end. I spoke with a few more conference-goers and took some final photos of the Yokohama Bay Bridge visible past the conference center windows. I'm glad I stayed for the closing plenary, I really am.</p>

</div>
<p>After the closing plenary, I took one last look at the conference hall before walking to the train station and taking a ride to Shibuya. I met up with my friend Kevin there to do a little shopping before heading home -- if only I'd realized that it was Golden Week! Shibuya was absolutely packed with people, even more than usual. I had a great time thrifting there, grabbed a nice shirt made from repurposed kimono cloth (I'd better make sure to keep it clean, I don't want to wash kimono cloth too frequently!). Kevin also got a nice pair of white and orange shoes from Onitsuka Tiger; I may have to pick some up next time I'm in Japan, they seem quite comfortable!</p>
<p>Getting back to Shibuya Station that night was very challenging, but also weirdly fun? I don't mind the feeling of blending into a crowd from time to time; after feeling oddly hyper-visible throughout my visit to Japan (I always feel that way when I go back), it felt nice to disappear for once. (‚Äî·¥ó‚Äî)</p>

<p>Hibby and I took one last trip to Yokohama Chinatown for <em>nikuman</em> that night (we actually visited on Saturday night as well, but realized the hard way that most Yokohama Chinatown locations do not accept credit card payments lol). Yokohama Chinatown was very quiet and relaxed tonight, few customers around, many businesses closing early; I suspect this was also due to Golden Week. I enjoyed my <em>nikuman</em> very much; I have fond memories of eating <em>nikuman</em> in Yokohama Chinatown as a little child, and remember them being as large as my face! Maybe they aren't anymore, but my face was a bit smaller when I was 4 years old.</p>

<p>...Damn. I'm really going back tomorrow morning. Feels like I just got here. So much more I wanted to do. ...Next time.</p>
<h3>02 May (Friday)</h3>
<p>Woke up, packed my remaining things, grabbed one last <em>konbini</em> breakfast (rice, fish, renkon, lots of other vegatables), checked out from the hotel, said bye to Hibby (who departed to a different hotel in Tokyo), then entered Sakuragich≈ç-eki for a train to Yokohama-eki, and from there to Haneda K≈´k≈ç. God, I'm going to miss these trains so much.</p>
<p>Met some other departing CHI attendees in-line at the airport check-in; we mostly talked about conferencing in general, navigating academia in 2025, businesses cards, and feeling burnt-out from screens. One uncomfortable pat-down (hate it everytime) and one overpriced food court <em>okonomiyaki</em> later (seriously, $12 for <em>okonomiyaki</em> the size of a pancake? Get real, pal!), I sat in the terminal and caught my last glimpse of Japan out the windows before boarding my plane. Cool, grey, and rainy outside.</p>

</div>
<p>...Farewell, Yokohama. I didn't know how much I missed you. I will come back one day.</p>
<hr>
<p>One twelve hour flight (and a bus ride from DTW to Ann Arbor) later, I found myself... right where I was one week and a day ago. Ann Arbor changes quickly in May -- the trees fill with blossoms and leaves, proud graduates walk around in caps and gowns, the roads get jam-packed with minivans and U-Hauls (but only for a short while -- State Street's not so bad once the undergrads leave).</p>
<p>I felt a little disoriented at first, reminding myself to use English and to stay on the right side of the sidewalk. I thought about the pedestrian walkways in many Japanese cities that connect major transit hubs to various popular destinations. I thought about how my grandmother and her friends would take train rides on the weekends from her remote rural mining town all the way to Fukuoka. I thought about how Ann Arbor is a little dorito-shaped town nestled between three major freeways, and how getting anywhere in under half an hour requires a car. I wondered how easily my grandmother could get around if she lived here.</p>
<p>I got home, ate a cheeseburger, took a shower, and went to bed.</p>
